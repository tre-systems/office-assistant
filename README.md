Manage Office 365 calendars by chatting in plain English. Just type what you need -- **"What's on my calendar today?"**, **"Schedule a meeting with Alice tomorrow at 2pm"**, **"Find a time that works for everyone"** -- and the assistant handles the rest.

Built for executive assistants and anyone who manages busy calendars, Office Assistant connects to Microsoft 365 and lets you create events, check availability, book rooms, manage other people's calendars, and more -- all through a simple chat interface.

---

## How it works

Office Assistant is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) server in Python. An MCP client such as Claude Code connects to it over stdio; the server exposes typed calendar tools that call the Microsoft Graph API on your behalf.

- **MCP server** -- FastMCP (official MCP Python SDK, 1.x line) with `@mcp.tool()` functions and lifespan-managed auth
- **Auth** -- MSAL device-code flow (public client, no stored secret); tokens cached owner-only at `~/.office-assistant/`
- **Graph client** -- typed async httpx client with retry/backoff, pagination, and auth-failure recovery
- **Quality** -- 179 tests (respx-mocked Graph calls, 80% coverage gate), mypy strict, ruff

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `list_events` | Read a calendar (yours or a shared one) over a date range |
| `create_event` | Create meetings, with a Teams link by default for work accounts |
| `update_event` / `cancel_event` | Reschedule, edit, or cancel |
| `respond_to_event` | Accept / tentative / decline invitations |
| `get_free_busy` | Availability for a set of people |
| `find_meeting_times` | Suggest slots that work for everyone |
| `list_rooms` | Find bookable meeting rooms |
| `list_calendars` / `get_my_profile` | Enumerate calendars, confirm the signed-in account |

A typical exchange:

```
> Find 30 minutes for me and alice@example.com tomorrow afternoon,
  then book it as "Roadmap catch-up".

  find_meeting_times(attendees=["alice@example.com"], duration=30, ...)
    -> 14:00-14:30 and 15:30-16:00 are free for both

  create_event(subject="Roadmap catch-up", start="14:00", attendees=[...])
    -> Created with a Teams link; invite sent

Booked for tomorrow 2:00-2:30pm. Alice has the invite.
```

To use it from any MCP client (Claude Code's `setup.sh` does this for you -- see below), the server config is:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "office-assistant": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/path/to/office-assistant", "python", "-m", "office_assistant"]
    }
  }
}
```

## What you can do

Once set up, just open Claude Code in the `office-assistant` folder and start typing. Here's what you can ask:

### View your schedule

```
What's on my calendar today?
Show me my meetings for next week
What do I have on Thursday?
```

### View someone else's calendar

```
What's on Alice's calendar tomorrow?
Show me bob@company.com's schedule for Monday
```

> The other person needs to have shared their calendar with you in Outlook for this to work.

### Create meetings

```
Schedule a meeting called "Project Review" tomorrow at 3pm
Book a 1-hour meeting with alice@company.com and bob@company.com on Friday at 10am
Set up a meeting about budget planning next Tuesday at 2pm in the Board Room
```

For work/school accounts, meetings include a Microsoft Teams link by default. If you want an in-person meeting, just say so:

```
Schedule an in-person meeting in Room 4A tomorrow at 11am
```

> Personal accounts don't support Teams meeting links. Meetings are created as in-person by default.

### Change or cancel meetings

```
Move the Project Review to 4pm
Cancel tomorrow's budget meeting
Cancel the 3pm meeting and let everyone know it's been postponed
```

### Recurring meetings

```
Set up a daily standup at 9am starting Monday
Schedule a weekly team sync every Tuesday and Thursday at 2pm for the next 3 months
Create a weekly budget review every Monday at 10am
```

### Accept or decline meetings

```
Accept the meeting invitation from Alice
Decline tomorrow's 3pm meeting with a note that I have a conflict
Tentatively accept the project review
```

### Manage someone else's calendar

If someone has granted you delegate access in Outlook, you can manage their calendar:

```
Schedule a meeting called "Board Review" on Sarah's calendar for Friday at 10am
Cancel the 2pm meeting on my manager's calendar
Accept the invitation on behalf of sarah@company.com
```

> To grant delegate access: in Outlook, the other person goes to **File** > **Account Settings** > **Delegate Access** > adds your email address.

### Check availability

```
Is alice@company.com free tomorrow afternoon?
Check if bob@company.com and carol@company.com are available on Thursday
```

### Find a time that works for everyone

```
Find a time for a 30-minute meeting with alice@company.com next week
When can bob@company.com, carol@company.com and I all meet for an hour?
```

### Book a meeting room

```
What meeting rooms are available?
Show me rooms in Building 2
Book the Boardroom for tomorrow's team meeting at 3pm
```

### Shortcut commands

You can also type these shortcuts to be guided step by step:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/calendar` | Answer questions about your calendar |
| `/schedule-meeting` | Walk you through creating a meeting step by step |
| `/find-time` | Find available meeting slots across multiple people |
| `/check-availability` | Check if people are free or busy |
| `/calendar-setup` | Help with signing in or fixing connection issues |

### Personal accounts

If you're using a personal Microsoft account (@outlook.com, @hotmail.com), most features work:

- Viewing your calendar
- Creating, editing, and cancelling events
- Recurring meetings
- Accepting, declining, or tentatively accepting invitations
- Adding notes and locations to events

A few features require a **work/school account** (Microsoft 365):

- Checking other people's availability
- Finding meeting times across multiple people
- Viewing other people's calendars
- Delegate calendar access (managing someone else's calendar)
- Meeting room discovery and booking
- Microsoft Teams meeting links

## Getting started

Setting up takes about 10 minutes. There are three parts: install the software, register an app with Microsoft, and sign in. If any of this feels unfamiliar, your IT department can help -- especially with the Azure registration part.

### What you'll need

- **A computer** running Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **A Microsoft account** -- either a work/school account (Office 365) or a personal account (@outlook.com, @hotmail.com)
- **Claude Code** -- install it first by following the [Claude Code installation guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview)

You do **not** need to install Python or any other programming tools -- the setup script handles everything automatically.

### Step 1: Download and install

Open a terminal and run these three commands, one at a time. Copy each line, paste it into the terminal, and press **Enter**:

```
git clone https://github.com/tre-systems/office-assistant.git
```
```
cd office-assistant
```
```
./setup.sh
```

The first command downloads the assistant. The second opens the folder. The third installs everything it needs to run.

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I open a terminal?</strong></summary>

- **Mac**: Press **Cmd + Space**, type **Terminal**, and press Enter.
- **Windows**: Press the Windows key, type **wsl**, and open it. If WSL isn't installed, see the Windows section below.
- **Linux**: Press **Ctrl + Alt + T** or look for Terminal in your applications menu.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"git" is not recognised / command not found</strong></summary>

Git is a tool used to download the assistant. It doesn't come pre-installed on most computers, but it's quick to add:

- **Mac**: Type `git` in the terminal and press Enter -- macOS will offer to install it for you. Click **Install** and wait for it to finish.
- **Windows (WSL)**: In your WSL terminal, type `sudo apt install git` and press Enter.
- **Windows (without WSL)**: Download the installer from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win), run it, then restart your terminal.

If you're not comfortable with this, ask your IT department -- it takes less than a minute.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows users: about WSL</strong></summary>

Office Assistant runs inside WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), which gives you a Linux environment on your Windows PC. Most modern Windows work computers already have this installed.

**To check:** open PowerShell (press the Windows key, type **PowerShell**) and type `wsl --status`.

**If it's not installed:** ask your IT department to run `wsl --install` in an administrator PowerShell -- it takes about 5 minutes and one restart.

Once WSL is set up, open it from the Start menu (type **wsl**) and run the install commands above inside the WSL terminal.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"./setup.sh: Permission denied"</strong></summary>

Type `bash setup.sh` instead and press Enter. This does the same thing.

</details>

The setup script will install all the software dependencies and then walk you through signing in. If you see any errors, jump to [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below.

### Step 2: Register an app in Azure

This step tells Microsoft that the Office Assistant is allowed to access your calendar. You only need to do this once. If your organisation restricts Azure access, ask your IT department to do this step for you -- they'll know what to do.

1. Go to **[portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)** in your web browser
2. Sign in with your **Microsoft account** (work, school, or personal)
3. In the search bar at the top, type **App registrations** and click the result
4. Click the **+ New registration** button
5. Fill in the form:
   - **Name**: `Office Assistant` (or anything you like -- this is just a label)
   - **Supported account types**: choose based on your account:
     - **Work/school account**: "Accounts in this organizational directory only"
     - **Personal account** (@outlook.com, @hotmail.com): "Personal Microsoft accounts only"
   - **Redirect URI**: leave this blank
6. Click **Register**

You'll now see an overview page for your new app:

7. Copy the **Application (client) ID** -- it's the long code that looks like `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890`. Save it somewhere -- you'll need it in a moment.

Now configure two more settings:

8. In the left sidebar, click **Authentication**
   - Scroll down to **Advanced settings**
   - Set **Allow public client flows** to **Yes**
   - Click **Save** at the top

9. In the left sidebar, click **API permissions**
   - Click **+ Add a permission**
   - Click **Microsoft Graph**
   - Click **Delegated permissions**
   - Search for and tick these permissions:
     - `Calendars.ReadWrite`
     - `Calendars.ReadWrite.Shared` (work/school accounts only -- skip this for personal accounts)
     - `Place.Read.All` (work/school accounts only -- skip this for personal accounts)
     - `User.Read`
   - Click **Add permissions**

### Step 3: Sign in

If the setup script from Step 1 already walked you through signing in, you're done! Otherwise, go back to your terminal and run:

```
cd office-assistant
uv run python -m office_assistant.setup
```

It will ask you for:
- Your **Application (client) ID** (the code you copied in step 7 above)
- Whether you're using a **work/school** or **personal** account

Then it will show a message like:

> To sign in, use a web browser to open https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code **ABCD1234**

1. Open that link in your browser
2. Enter the code shown in the terminal
3. Sign in with your Microsoft account
4. Click **Accept** when asked to approve the permissions

That's it! Your sign-in is saved for about 90 days. When it expires, just use any calendar command and the assistant will automatically prompt you to sign in again -- you'll see the same link and code as before.

---

## Using the assistant

Once set up, open Claude Code in the `office-assistant` folder and start chatting. You don't need to remember any special commands -- just describe what you need in plain English.

If the assistant ever has trouble connecting, type `/calendar-setup` and it will help you fix it.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "CLIENT_ID and TENANT_ID must be set"

The assistant hasn't been set up yet, or the setup didn't finish. Go back to your terminal and run:

```
cd office-assistant
uv run python -m office_assistant.setup
```

### "Could not start device-code flow"

Your Azure app may not have the right setting enabled. Go back to the Azure Portal, find your app under **App registrations**, click **Authentication**, and make sure **Allow public client flows** is set to **Yes**. Don't forget to click **Save**.

### "You don't have permission to view this person's calendar"

The other person hasn't shared their calendar with you. Ask them to share it: in Outlook, they go to **Calendar**, right-click their calendar, choose **Sharing and Permissions**, and add your email address.

### "ErrorAccessDenied" on any calendar operation

This usually means one of two things:

1. **Missing permissions**: Go back to Step 2 above and check that all the required permissions are listed under **API permissions** in the Azure portal.
2. **Personal account limitation**: Some features (checking availability, finding meeting times, room booking) only work with work/school accounts. The assistant will tell you if this is the case.

### "Approval required" or admin consent screen

Your organisation requires an admin to approve apps that access calendar data. You have two options:

1. **Ask your IT admin** to grant consent for the app in the Azure portal
2. **Use a personal Microsoft account** (@outlook.com, @hotmail.com) instead -- register a new app under that account and sign in with it

### The login expired

Just use any calendar command -- the assistant will automatically detect the expired sign-in and prompt you to sign in again. You'll see a link and a code, same as the first time.

### Something else isn't working

Type `/calendar-setup` in Claude Code -- it will check your connection and guide you through fixing common issues.
